## What Problem Does This Solve?

Your friend mentions their job interview. You care deeply. But weeks pass, and you realize you never asked how it went. Tilly gives relationships their own space - not buried in contacts, todos, or notes - so you remember what matters and reach out at the right time.

There are other apps already. Tilly is my take on simplicity and joy of use. And the AI assistant makes it easy to keep going.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ccssmnn/tilly.git
cd tilly
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env # (see setup section)
pnpm dev
```

## Setup

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add:

- **Jazz sync server** - Client-side encrypted sync storage and authentication (get key from jazz.tools)
- **Google Gemini API key** - For Tilly Chat assistant
- **VAPID keys** - Push notifications (generate with `npx web-push generate-vapid-keys`)
- **Cron secret** - Random string for scheduled jobs

**Note**: Tilly now uses Jazz's built-in Passkey authentication instead of Clerk. Your data is encrypted with keys derived from your passkey, providing secure, passwordless authentication.

## Architecture

Tilly is a **React PWA** built with:

- **App**: React + TanStack Router + Shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- **API Endpoints**: Astro serving marketing pages + Hono API routes
- **Database**: [Jazz](https://jazz.tools) - Client-side encrypted, distributed, offline-first
- **Auth**: Jazz Passkey Authentication (WebAuthn-based, biometric)
- **AI**: AI SDK with Google
- **Deployment**: Vercel

**Key Design**: Single Astro dev server hosts marketing site, PWA, and API routes together.

## Data & Privacy

**Encryption**: Data is encrypted in the browser before syncing to Jazz. Encryption keys are derived from your passkey (stored securely by your device/browser) and managed by Jazz's cryptographic system. The Tilly server worker has limited access only to deliver push notifications and power Tilly Assistant. Jazz Cloud stores only encrypted data.

**Authentication**: Uses WebAuthn passkeys for secure, passwordless authentication. Your passkey is stored by your device (via FaceID, TouchID, Windows Hello, or security keys) and syncs across your devices through your browser/OS ecosystem.

**Offline-First**: All data syncs through Jazz and works offline. AI assistant is the only feature requiring an active internet connection and shares the conversation you send with the AI provider.

**Data Control**: Full JSON export/import. No vendor lock-in. Move from or to your own hosted version anytime.

## Development

```bash
pnpm dev          # Start dev server
pnpm build        # Build for production
pnpm check        # TypeScript compilation check
```

## Self-Hosting

Deploy to Vercel with your own:

- Jazz sync server (database and authentication)
- Google Gemini API key (assistant)
- VAPID keys (push notifications)

See [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed deployment instructions.
